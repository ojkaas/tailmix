# tailmix

tailmix connects one host to multiple Tailscale tailnets at the same time.

tailmix is an independent project and is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or
endorsed by Tailscale Inc. Tailscale is a registered trademark of Tailscale
Inc.

## Start here

You only need to install it, connect one profile, and check that it works.

Before starting, disconnect the regular Tailscale client. It can otherwise
compete with tailmix for routes and DNS.

### 1. Install and start tailmix

Choose your operating system.

**macOS**

```sh
curl -fLO https://github.com/maisem/tailmix/releases/latest/download/install.sh
sudo sh install.sh
```

**Linux with systemd**

```sh
curl -fLO https://github.com/maisem/tailmix/releases/latest/download/install.sh
sudo sh install.sh
```

For Linux prerequisites and troubleshooting, see the
[systemd guide](docs/linux-install.md).

**Windows**

Extract `tailmix-windows-amd64.zip` (or `-arm64`) and run `install.ps1`. It
installs the `tailmixd` service and a tray app that offers the official
client's everyday controls. On Windows, tailmix can run next to the official
client. See the [Windows guide](docs/windows.md).

### 2. Connect your first tailnet

Pick a short profile name such as `work`:

```sh
sudo tailmix profiles add work
sudo tailmix ts --profile work up
```

Open the login link printed by the second command.

### 3. Check it

```sh
tailmix version
tailmixd --version
tailmix status
tailmix ts --profile work status
```

If the version prints, `work` is listed, and the final command shows the
tailnet, you are done.

To connect another tailnet, repeat step 2 with a different profile name.

Direct installations check stable GitHub releases after a randomized startup
delay and then daily. Both binaries switch versions together and the daemon
restarts itself without a service timer. Release checksums are verified after
download; authenticity relies on GitHub's HTTPS and release access controls.
Manage the policy with:

```sh
tailmix update status
sudo tailmix update check
sudo tailmix update apply
sudo tailmix update disable # or: enable
```

Homebrew remains available for source-based macOS installations, but those
installations are updated by Homebrew rather than tailmix itself.

## Shell completion

Homebrew installs completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, fish, and PowerShell
automatically. For other installation methods, load a completion script in the
current shell with one of these commands:

```sh
# Bash
source <(tailmix completion bash)

# Zsh
source <(tailmix completion zsh)

# fish
tailmix completion fish | source
```

For PowerShell:

```powershell
tailmix completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

The scripts complete tailmix commands and flags, local profile names, and the
embedded Tailscale CLI after `tailmix ts --profile <profile>`.

## Common next steps

Pause every profile without changing which profiles should normally run:

```sh
sudo tailmix down
sudo tailmix up
```

The down state survives daemon restarts and host reboots. `tailmix up` restores
only profiles that were enabled before the pause; use `tailmix profiles enable`
or `disable` while tailmix is up to change that restore set. Profile lifecycle
and configuration changes are rejected while tailmix is down.

List everything before changing policy:

```sh
tailmix routes list
tailmix exit-node list
tailmix dns routes list
tailmix dns search list
```

`tailmix status` starts with the global up/down state and summarizes the policy
currently selected from every active profile. It includes accepted IP routes,
the selected exit node, effective DNS routes, and configured DNS search domains
without listing every available choice.

Like Tailscale's CLI, `tailmix exit-node list` collapses located nodes to the
highest-priority node per city and adds an **Any** row for countries with
multiple cities. Use `tailmix exit-node list --filter Canada` to show every
node in one country.

Accept every advertised subnet route and DNS route from one profile:

```sh
sudo tailmix routes set --profile work --accept-all=true
sudo tailmix dns routes set --profile work --accept-all=true
```

Pin one subnet to a profile:

```sh
sudo tailmix routes bind --profile work 10.20.0.0/16
```

Send default traffic through one exit node:

```sh
sudo tailmix exit-node set --profile work gateway
```

`gateway` may be the node's short hostname, full DNS name, stable node ID, or
Tailscale IP. Run `sudo tailmix exit-node clear` to return to the host's normal
default route.

Enable Tailscale SSH on one profile:

```sh
sudo tailmix ts --profile work set --ssh
```

The tailnet must also have Tailscale SSH enabled and grant access to the node in
its access-control policy.

Route a DNS suffix through a profile, then make it a search domain so short
names such as `printer` can expand to `printer.corp.example.com`:

```sh
sudo tailmix dns routes bind --profile work corp.example.com
sudo tailmix dns search add corp.example.com
```

Explicit bindings override profile-wide accept-all settings. Changes apply
without restarting `tailmixd`.

Run `tailmix help` for every command. `-p` is shorthand for `--profile`
everywhere. Status and other read-only commands work as a regular local user;
commands that change daemon-managed state require root.

## How it works

`tailmixd` runs one embedded Tailscale node per profile and connects them to one
host TUN. It gives overlapping node and Tailscale Service addresses stable
local addresses, then uses your route and DNS bindings to choose the right
profile. Service MagicDNS names resolve to those effective addresses just like
node names. `tailmix` changes policy through a local socket, so adding profiles
or changing bindings does not restart unrelated profiles.

One exit node can be selected across all profiles. Direct peer and accepted
subnet routes remain profile-specific and take precedence over that default.
The selected exit-node profile also supplies DNS for otherwise-unmatched names.
More-specific DNS routes, including automatic MagicDNS zones, keep precedence.
An explicitly bound root (`.`) replaces the exit-node DNS default and remains
configured when the exit node is changed or cleared.
